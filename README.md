# Nobel
Hiii first thanks for giving me opurtunity to work with this project.
All the code HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT,JQUERY written in a Single file.

->Executing the project ********

Unable to publish the project through git as we are fetching content from unown API which is not possible becuase of git publishes over https and it doesnt allow the unknown sites.

 Please take the index.html file and run it in your local.
 one can simply execute the project with chrome or any online browser as I have used localstorage for storing data

->Technologies used

I have used technologies like HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT,JQUERY.

STEPS FOR BUILDING THE PROJECT

1.feteched the data from api using fetch();

2.converted the fetched data in to json using .json();

3.Iterated through the JSON tree and display the processed and required data in to the UI.
